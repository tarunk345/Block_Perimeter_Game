# Block_Perimeter_Game

Hi! This is a game I created for an Algorithms and Data Structures Class. The game is a block perimeter game, a multiplayer game in which a player is assigned one of two goals: 1. to get as much of one color on the perimeter of the game square as they can within their given moves, or 2. To create the biggest blob (connected squares) of their assigned color within their given moves.

In order to play the game, run BlockGame.java!
